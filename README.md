# CruS Mod Base
Adds useful modding things (in the future) and custom level support.

Requires the [CRUELTY SQUAD MOD LOADER](https://github.com/crustyrashky/crus-modloader)

## Features

- Custom level support
- Button in settings that tells you what mods you have installed

2. Extract its folder to `%appdata%\Godot\app_userdata\Cruelty Squad\levels`
   - This folder is created automatically if you run the game with the mod installed, or you can create it yourself

## Level config JSON properties

- File paths are strings starting with `user://` (Godot equivalent of `%appdata%\Godot\app_userdata\Cruelty Squad\`) or `res://` (game files)
