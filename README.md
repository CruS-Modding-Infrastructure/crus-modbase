# CruS Mod Base
Adds useful modding things (in the future) and custom level support.

Requires the [CRUELTY SQUAD MOD LOADER](https://github.com/crustyrashky/crus-modloader)

## Features

- Custom level support
- Button in settings that tells you what mods you have installed

## Install

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/crustyrashky/crus-modbase/releases/download/0.0.1/crus-modbase.zip)
2. Extract the `Crus Mod Base` folder to  `%appdata%\Godot\app_userdata\Cruelty Squad\mods`

## Adding custom levels

1. Download a level, like [this one](https://github.com/crustyrashky/crus-modbase/releases/download/0.0.1/SinSpaceExtended.zip)
2. Extract its folder to `%appdata%\Godot\app_userdata\Cruelty Squad\levels`
   - This folder is created automatically if you run the game with the mod installed, or you can create it yourself
