# CruS Mod Base

Adds useful modding things (in the future), custom level support and more.

Requires the [CRUELTY SQUAD MOD LOADER](https://github.com/crustyrashky/crus-modloader)

## Features

- Custom level support
- Button in settings that tells you what mods you have installed
- Build custom levels right from TrenchBroom with minimal Godot use
- Cheats
- Take fun little snapshots of levels

## Install

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/CruS-Modding-Infrastructure/crus-modbase/releases)
2. Extract the `CruS Mod Base` folder to  `%appdata%\Godot\app_userdata\Cruelty Squad\mods`

## Adding custom levels

1. Download a level
2. Extract its folder to `%appdata%\Godot\app_userdata\Cruelty Squad\levels`
   - This folder is created automatically if you run the game with the mod installed, or you can create it yourself
